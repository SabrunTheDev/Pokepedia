# Poképedia

Welcome to Poképedia, a web application that allows you to search and learn about various Pokémon!

## Overview

This project utilizes JavaScript to interact with the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch information about Pokémon. It features a user-friendly interface where you can search for Pokémon by name and get detailed information about them, including images and species details. (Search for Pikachu & Pikachi-world-hat 😀)

## Features

- **Pokémon Search:** Use the search bar to find information about your favorite Pokémon.
- **Dynamic Display:** The application dynamically displays the selected Pokémon's image and species details.
- **Random Pokémon Facts:** Learn interesting facts about the Pokémon species through randomly selected flavor text. Resubmitting the same Pokémon will return a different, randomized fact.

## Usage

- Type the name of a Pokémon in the search bar and press Enter to get detailed information.
- Explore different Pokémon species and refresh the page to discover new ones.
